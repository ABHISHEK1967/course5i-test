# course5i-test

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 10.0.5.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Fake Backend server 

Run json-server --watch price.json after ng serve in a new command window. Since it is a UI task I have used json-server npm package with price.json as the data file which has the corresponding json data.

## UI component 

PrimeNg is used as the opensource angular UI component library and bootstrap for navbar and card-body.
